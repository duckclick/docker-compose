# docker-compose

Make sure you have `docker-compose` installed. Then, from the root directory of the repository:

## build images
```sh
docker-compose build
```

## run the services

```sh
docker-compose up
```

To stop the services, use Ctrl-C. Alternatively, run the services with `docker-compose up -d` and stop them with `docker-compose stop`.
